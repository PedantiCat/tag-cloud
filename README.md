# tag-cloud
A last.fm tag cloud generator build on Vue!

Give it a whirl: [theteacat.github.io/tag-cloud/](https://theteacat.github.io/tag-cloud/)


## How it do? Why are big and small? Grandpa?

If you want to have a scrawl over how exactly this picks out tags, you'll want to have a look at [/src/assets/js/Generator.js](https://github.com/TheTeaCat/tag-cloud/blob/master/src/assets/js/Generator.js).

If you don't like it, cry me a river! :sob: :sob: :sob:

:rowboat: <- me, rowing around in a sea of your tears. :droplet: xoxo
